"""
LEE3D shared data contract.

The `Profile` model below is the SINGLE source of truth that flows between the
three repos:

    LEE3D-Frontend  --(exports profile.json)-->  LEE3D-Backend-A
    LEE3D-Backend-A --(generates STL/STEP)----->  LEE3D-Lib

Field names match the JSON the browser app writes, byte-for-byte, so a profile
exported in the UI drops straight into `POST /generate`.
